INSERT INTO
The INSERT INTO statement is used to add new rows of data to a table. You specify the table name and the values for each column.

ex
INSERT INTO dish (id, name, price)
VALUES (1, 'Pasta', 14);


INSERT INTO SELECT

The INSERT INTO SELECT statement is used to insert data into a table by selecting data from another table. This is useful for copying data from one table to another.

example
INSERT INTO dish_archive (id, name, price)
SELECT id, name, price
FROM dish;

insert into the table dish_archive from dish table cause same data and condition/requirement should fulfilled


Q12 What are the risks of not using a WHERE clause in an UPDATE statement?
->

performance impact

Q13.Explain about IS NULL and IS NOT NULL.

ans-> NULL and IS NOT NULL  are operators in the SQL:

The IS NULL operator is used to test for empty values (NULL values) in a column. A NULL value represents missing or unknown data.
   > SELECT * FROM table_Name where col_name IS NULL;     
 
-- This will retrives all rows from table where the column has null values

The IS NOT NULL operator is used to test for non-empty values (non-NULL values) in a column.,

> SELECT * FROM table_Name where col_name IS NOT NULL;  

This will retrives all rows from table where the column dows not have a null values

--
Use Cases
--
Data Cleaning: Identifying and handling rows with missing data.

Conditional Logic: Applying different logic based on the presence or absence of data.


Q14How to load data from csv file into database table using MySQL workbench.

ANS-> First we have to create our csv file in correct format
and then in Work bench we have to select the database and table in which we have to add the csv file
and now we have to open the table using select command so will get the option for import and export 
with the import we can import our csv file from local to DAtabase table.

TIPS:
Backup Your Data: Always backup your database before performing bulk 				imports.
Data Validation: Ensure the data in your CSV file is clean and matches the 		table schema to avoid import error

Q15How to copy data from existing table to new table.

ANs-> 
with this below command will able to copy 

	INSERT INTO new_table (column1, column2, column3, ...)
	SELECT column1, column2, column3, ...
	FROM existing_table;

Q16 Explain about CRUD operation

Ans-> Crud Operations are the four basic functions to persistence storage in databases:
CRUD stands for  CREATE,READ,UPDATE and DELETE

CREATE:

The CREATE operation add new records to the database.
this typically done by INSERT statement in SQL
	INSERT INTO employees (name, position, salary)
	VALUES ('John Doe', 'Software Engineer', 60000);

READ:

the read operation retrives data from the database
This is usually done using the SELECT statement.
	SELECT * FROM employees WHERE position = 'Software Engineer';


UPDATE:

The UPDATE operation modifies existing record in the database.
this is done using the UPDATE statement
	UPDATE employees
	SET salary = 65000
	WHERE name = 'John Doe';

DELETE :
The delete operations removes records from the database.
this is done using the DELETE statement
	DELETE FROM employees
	WHERE name = 'John Doe';
